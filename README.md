# VBS Service
VBS -- Vehicle Bus Service (talks to the CAN and forwards the info to ATS)

These projects require the correct system signing keys. Different hardware platforms have different keys. Sample files are included for you to copy and edit so they point to the correct keys.

Copy and edit these files in project root directory:

	"tab8keys.properties.sample" to "tab8keys.properties"

The configuration.xml file goes to `/sdcard/ATS` for the Tab8.
